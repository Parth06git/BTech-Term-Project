# Graph codes

This directory contains code for to obtain graphs used in the manuscript. **Note that only networkx graphs are generated here. Code to preprocess and prepare the networkx graphs for the ML model are in the folder named "ML".** If the json files are obtained from the [OpenBU](https://open.bu.edu/handle/2144/43730), then look at section [Json Files](#Json-Files-(json_to_nx.py)). Note that this code works for *all* subdatasets.

## Graph generation from image (graph_gen.py)

This code is for generating graphs with the domain generated images with subdata*_geometry.zip

The code is run with the following versions:

* networkx: 2.5.1
* skimage: 0.18.1

Segmentation to replicate sparse, medium, and dense node densities as in paper:
 
 Subdataset 1:
 * sparse: 350 segments
 * medium: 600 segments
 * dense: 1100 segments

 Subdataset 2:
 * sparse: 220 segments
 * medium: 400 segments
 * dense: 790 segments

 Subdataset 3:
 * sparse: 700 segments
 * medium: 1000 segments
 * dense: 2300 segments

Note that for subdataset 1, the images have to be resized from 5x40 to 100x800 before segmentation. This step is provided in the code and is not necessary for subdatasets 2 and subdatasets 3.

Also note that the graph features are not normalized. Normalizing the features help with training.

## Normalizing Graph features (normalize_feature.py)
This code is used to normalize feature vectors to help training.
 
## Exact Representations (subdataset1_exact.py and subdataset2_exact.py)
This code generates perfect representations for subdataset1 and subdataset2 in our manuscript. 

## Json Files (json_to_nx.py)
This code converts the [json files](https://open.bu.edu/handle/2144/43730) obtaimed from the dataset into networkx graphs. The obtained graphs can be used in the next section (ML).
